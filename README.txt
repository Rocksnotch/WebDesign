-----Updates from P1-----
-Added more text to the home page
-Centered text both vertically and horizontally to the images
-Navbar is the dynamic CSS for this page

-----Updates from P2-----
-Added 'Employees' page
-Employees page includes 5 buttons, all with hover and active colors
-Footer is now dynamic, and will always stick to the bottom of the page
-Hover buttons are the dynamic CSS for this page
-Missing an 'All' button, but appears P3 will want this so will wait to add till then
-5 employee categories, 3 employees each category

-----General Notes-----
-Images not visible in Visual Studio due to them being .webp, however .webp loads faster and has a smaller file size, allowing for more images
